Build instructions:

To create a native library, set up the environment and build library by executing
from bash prompt:

% export MAKEFILE=Makefile.sys
% make

To set up a cross-compile library, the environment variable OSTYPE must be
set to the target OS type.  Platform names are subdirectories in the ./platforms
directory.  In addition, BUILD_TOOL needs to be set to identify the path and
prefix of the cross toolchain.

Known issues:

Areas that need attention or that are still unimplemented are marked with a comment
that contains "eyeballs" (.)(.) followed by the nature of the issue as understood.
